# Yuxu's Game of Life

A GPU-accelerated genome-based evolution simulation where neural network organisms compete, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection and reinforcement learning.

## Features

### Core Evolution System
- **Genome-Based Identity**: 12-dimensional genome (8 neural fingerprint + 4 chemical affinity) determines each organism's identity
- **No Fixed Species**: Organisms cluster naturally based on genome similarity, no predetermined species
- **Sexual Reproduction**: Genetic crossover where offspring inherit 50% neurons from each parent
- **Emergent Speciation**: Similar genomes form natural breeding groups, visible through color clustering

### Advanced Training & Validation
- **Continuous Evolution**: Networks evolve through both inheritance and reinforcement learning
- **Lineage Tracking**: Validates training effectiveness by tracking trained vs random lineages across generations
- **Auto-Save System**: Best networks automatically saved every 2 minutes (configurable)
- **Generational Metrics**: Track performance of Gen0, Gen1-5, Gen6+ descendants vs pure random

### Chemical Ecology
- **4-Chemical System**: Genome-encoded chemical preferences for signaling and territory marking
- **Dynamic Diffusion**: Chemicals spread (30%) and decay (5%) each step
- **Genome-Driven Secretion**: Each cell secretes based on its chemical affinity genes

### Technical Excellence

```

## How It Works

### Genome-Based Identity

Each organism has a **12-dimensional genome**:

```
Genome = [Neural Fingerprint (8-dim)] + [Chemical Affinity (4-dim)]

Neural Fingerprint:
  - Mean, Std, Abs-mean, Max from w1 layer
  - Mean, Std, Abs-mean, Max from w2 layer

Chemical Affinity:
  - Preferences for secreting 4 different chemicals
```

**Key Properties**:
- Genome distance < 0.5 → Compatible mates (can reproduce)
- Genome distance ≥ 0.5 → Valid prey (can be eaten)
- Similar genomes → Similar colors (natural clustering)

### Reproduction & Inheritance

**Sexual Reproduction** (preferred):
1. Find nearby organism with similar genome (distance < 0.5)
2. Offspring inherits:
   - 50% neurons from parent 1 (random selection)
   - 50% neurons from parent 2 (random selection)
   - Genome crosses over and mutates (10% rate)
3. Child placed in adjacent empty cell

**Asexual Reproduction** (fallback):
- If no compatible mate nearby, clone with mutation
- Ensures reproduction even when isolated

### Lineage Tracking System

The simulation tracks **trained lineages** to validate network quality:

```
Generation 0:
  - 1% cells inherit best_brain.pt (ELITE_RATIO=0.01)
  - 99% cells start with random weights

All cells continuously learn via reinforcement learning

Lineage Tracking:
  - Gen 0: Direct inheritance from saved weights
  - Gen 1-5: Near descendants (1-5 generations from trained)
  - Gen 6+: Far descendants (6+ generations from trained)
  - Random: No trained ancestry

Validation Metrics:
  - Population ratio (Trained vs Random)
  - Average lifetime comparison
  - Average reproduction comparison
  - Performance ratio (should be >1.0 if training works)
```

**How to Validate Training**:
- Set `ELITE_RATIO = 0.01` (1% trained, 99% random)
- Run for 5-10 minutes
- If trained lineage grows from 1% to >30%: ✓ Training successful
- If trained lineage stays at 1-2%: ✗ Training ineffective

### Neural Network Architecture

**Input (24 neurons)**:
- 8 neighbor energy levels
- Similar/different genome counts
- Own energy and neighbor density
- 4 local chemical concentrations
- 8 reserved slots

**Hidden (8 neurons)**: Fully connected with tanh activation

**Output (7 actions)**:
- Stay (0)
- Move: Up, Down, Left, Right (1-4)
- Eat (5)
- Reproduce (6)

### Reinforcement Learning

**Policy Gradient Updates**:
```python
Rewards:
  - Eat prey: +2.0
  - Escape attack: +1.0
  - Reproduce: +1.5

Learning rate: 0.01
Updates: Every step based on actions taken
```

All organisms learn continuously, creating an arms race between trained and random lineages.

### Tissue Mechanics

**Enclosed Space Filling**:
- Empty cells surrounded by 8 similar organisms get filled
- New cell averages genome and weights from neighbors
- Creates dense tissue structures

**Tissue Fission** (rare):
- Large connected organisms (100+ cells) may split
- 10% chance per check
- Mutation applied during split (50% keep, 50% randomize)

### Fitness & Persistence

**Fitness Function**:
```python
fitness = lifetime + reproduction_count × 10
```
(Reproduction weighted 10x because it's harder to achieve)

**Auto-Save**:
- Best network saved every 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Asynchronous saving prevents stuttering
- Tracks best individual across entire population

### Performance Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Step Time** | 180ms | 40ms | **4.5x faster** |
| **FPS** | 10 | 25 | **2.5x smoother** |
| **Population** | 5000+ | 5000+ | No change |
| **GPU Memory** | Dynamic | Pre-allocated | More stable |
| **Render Quality** | Good | Excellent | Smoother colors |

**Trade-offs**:
- Experience Replay adds 32% overhead (25 FPS vs 33 FPS without)
- Multi-objective fitness adds richness but requires careful parameter tuning
- Real-time parameter adjustment requires moderate screen space

**Recommendation**: Keep default settings for balanced performance and features (25 FPS). Disable `RL_USE_REPLAY` for maximum performance (33 FPS) if needed.

## Understanding the Validation Results

### Example: Successful Training

```
Generation 0: Trained 1%, Random 99%
1 minute:     Trained 15%, Random 85%  ← Rapid growth = good training
5 minutes:    Trained 60%, Random 40%
10 minutes:   Trained 85%, Random 15%

Validation Report:
  Trained Lineage: 85%
  Random: 15%
  Lifetime Ratio: 1.3x ✓ BETTER

→ Conclusion: Training very successful!
```

### Example: Ineffective Training

```
Generation 0: Trained 1%, Random 99%
10 minutes:   Trained 1%, Random 99%  ← No growth = poor training

Validation Report:
  Trained Lineage: 1%
  Random: 99%
  Lifetime Ratio: 0.9x ✗ WORSE

→ Conclusion: Training did not learn useful behaviors
```

### Long-term Dynamics

After 5000+ generations, both trained and random lineages converge to optimal strategies through continuous reinforcement learning. At this point:
- Performance becomes similar (ratio ≈ 1.0)
- Population ratio stabilizes based on historical advantage
- Trained lineage maintains dominance due to early head-start

This validates that: (1) training provides early advantage, (2) RL allows random to catch up, (3) early advantage determines long-term dominance.

## Advanced Features

### Dominance-Based Mutation

When a genome cluster exceeds 30% of population (checked every 100 generations):
- System applies forced mutation to maintain diversity
- 70% of neurons randomized, 30% kept
- Prevents single lineage from complete domination
- Maintains evolutionary pressure

### Generational Validation Report

Every 200 generations, detailed console output:

```
======================================================================
GENERATIONAL VALIDATION - Generation 200
======================================================================

Population by Lineage:
  Gen 0 (Direct trained):       120 (  1.4%)
  Gen 1-5 (Near descendants):  2500 ( 29.1%)
  Gen 6+ (Far descendants):    4800 ( 55.9%)
  Random (No trained ancestry): 1180 ( 13.7%)
  ----------------------------------------
  Total Trained Lineage:        7420 ( 86.3%)

** PRIMARY COMPARISON: Trained Lineage vs Random **
  Lifetime:     58.3 vs  45.2  =  1.29x ✓ BETTER
  Reproduction:  2.42 vs  1.85  =  1.31x ✓ BETTER
  Energy:       27.8 vs  24.3  =  1.14x ✓ BETTER

Breakdown by Generation:
  Lifetime:     Gen0= 82.3  Gen1-5= 65.2  Gen6+= 58.1
  Reproduction: Gen0= 3.20  Gen1-5= 2.80  Gen6+= 2.50
